"""The `method.json` manifest — how a method that lives elsewhere is named.

A directory under `piper/methods/` holds either a bundle (`.mthds` files) or this one-line
manifest naming a hosted catalog id (`method_id`) or a published address (`method_ref`). It lives
in the package rather than in `scripts/` because it is read at both ends of a method's life:
`make codegen` reads it to regenerate the typed models, and a command written by `make add-method`
reads it every time it runs. One reader for both is what keeps them from disagreeing — editing
the tag and running `make codegen` moves the models and the run to the new version together.
