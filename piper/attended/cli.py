"""The attended CLI — start a durable run, then wait here for its result.

`client.start(...)` submits the run server-side (it survives anything, including
the ~30s cap that kills `piper blocking`), and `client.wait_for_result(...)` polls
it to completion from this terminal. The run id is printed *before* polling starts,
so once you see it, a Ctrl-C doesn't lose the run: it keeps executing server-side and
you resume it with `piper detached wait <id>`. (A Ctrl-C while the start request is
still in flight is the one window with no id to resume from.)

The SDK also offers `start_and_wait()`, a self-healing one-liner that picks the
right path by itself — that is the production shortcut. This starter spells the
lifecycle out because teaching the difference is the point.

Copy-paste unit: this file + `piper/inputs.py` + `piper/errors.py`. The three mode
packages never share lifecycle code, so the demo commands below are deliberate
mirrors of their `blocking` / `detached` twins: only `start_and_wait()` differs.
