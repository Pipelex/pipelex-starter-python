"""Build the inputs a pipe run is given — shared by every execution mode.

Input encoding is orthogonal to *how* a run is executed, so it lives here rather
than in one of the mode packages (`piper/blocking`, `piper/attended`,
`piper/detached`), which never share lifecycle code with each other.

Two shapes cover the demos:

- `read_text_input()` — a text argument, a `--file` pointing at one, or (when you
  give neither) a built-in sample, so every demo runs with zero arguments.
- `upload_document_input()` — a local file, uploaded to hosted Pipelex storage with
  `client.upload_file`, then wrapped in the `Document` envelope the API expects:
  `{"concept": "Document", "content": {"url": <pipelex-storage:// URI>, "filename":
  ..., "mime_type": ...}}`. A hosted run cannot see your filesystem, so the file is
  uploaded first and the run request carries only the URI, never the bytes. Preparation
  is deliberately a separate step from running: a file error surfaces before any run
  exists, and the uploaded asset is reusable across retries and modes. The pure
  `build_document_input(path, uri)` assembles the envelope once the URI is known.

The built-in samples let a fresh clone show a working result before you have any
input of your own; they are also the values the README documents.
