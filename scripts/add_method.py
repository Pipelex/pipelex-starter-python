"""Scaffold a method that lives elsewhere into this CLI — what `make add-method` runs.

This is the second way a method reaches `piper`. The first is the one the three demos tell:
the bundle lives at `piper/methods/<name>/main.mthds`, `make codegen` projects it, and a
person writes the command that uses the projection. This script is the same story for a
method that lives **on the platform** (a catalog id) or **in a published package** (an
address): the method stays where it is, a one-line `method.json` names it, and the whole
Python fan-out is written from the method's own contract.

It writes exactly three things — the manifest, the generated tree, and one Typer command in
the execution mode you chose:

    piper/methods/<slug>/method.json          the selector, and nothing else
    piper/generated/<package>/models.py       stamped, plus codegen.lock and __init__.py
    piper/<mode>/cli.py                       its imports and one command, at the anchors

**Nothing is written until everything has been fetched and derived.** The run has a read-only
half — parse the selector, validate the method, choose the pipe, derive every name, map every
input, check every collision and locate the anchors — and a write half that runs only once all
of that has passed. Every refusal happens in the first half with nothing on disk changed, and
`--dry-run` stops at the boundary and prints the plan. The write half writes all three or none:
a failure inside it takes back what it had written, so a failed run never leaves a half-added
method for the next run to refuse and for `make codegen` to pick up.

The command it writes reads the selector from `method.json` every time it runs, rather than
carrying a copy of it, so editing the manifest's tag and running `make codegen` moves the models
and the run to the new version together.

It is one-shot, like its JS twin: it never overwrites, and `make codegen` is the refresh. The
command it writes is yours from the moment it lands — edit it, rename it, split it; nothing
here ever reads it again.

Its JS twin is `pipelex-starter-js/scripts/lib/add-method.mts`, and the differences between
the two are deliberate and documented in `docs/add-method.md`.
