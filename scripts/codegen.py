"""Regenerate the committed typed clients for every method in `widget/methods/`.

This is what `make codegen` runs, and it needs nothing but `PIPELEX_API_KEY`: the
projection is done by the hosted API (`POST /v1/codegen`, reached through
`pipelex-sdk`, the starter's own dependency), not by a local `pipelex` runtime.
The `pipelex` CLI is deliberately not installed here, so asking a Python user to
find one before `make codegen` works was asking them to install the whole engine
to read three models. Its JS twin is `pipelex-starter-js/scripts/codegen.mts`.

One generated tree per method, mirroring `widget/methods/` one-to-one: each method
is its own closure, so each gets its own crate, artifact set and lock. The tree is
written **verbatim** — every `artifacts[]` entry at its `path`, the `lock` as
`codegen.lock` — because that byte-for-byte fidelity is what makes it identical to
a local `pipelex codegen types` run, and therefore what lets the offline drift
check (`make codegen-check`) pass on it. Reformatting an artifact or
re-serializing the lock breaks that trust chain, which is why the writing is
`pipelex-sdk`'s `write_codegen_tree` and not a loop of our own: it validates every
path first, refuses to overwrite a file codegen does not own, writes only what
changed, and prunes stamped artifacts that dropped out of the set.

A method directory names its closure in one of exactly two ways, and never both:

- **`.mthds` files** — the bundle lives here, and the whole directory is sent as inline
  `files`. This is what the three demos do.
- **`method.json`** — a one-line manifest holding a hosted catalog id (`method_id`) or a
  published address (`method_ref`), for a method that lives elsewhere. `make add-method`
  writes one; regenerating it is this same script, with the selector in place of the files.

Keeping the manifest under `widget/methods/` rather than beside the generated tree is what
makes the second kind almost free: `widget/methods/` stays the source of truth,
`widget/generated/` stays purely derived, and a selector-sourced tree is regenerated beside a
bundle-sourced one instead of through a second path.

Nothing here is method-specific: methods are discovered from the filesystem, so
adding one to `widget/methods/` is all it takes for the next run to generate it.
