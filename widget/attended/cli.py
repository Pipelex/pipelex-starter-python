"""The attended CLI — start a durable run, then wait here for its result.

`client.start(...)` submits the run server-side (it survives anything, including
the ~30s cap that kills `widget blocking`), and `client.wait_for_result(...)` polls
it to completion from this terminal. The run id is printed *before* polling starts,
so once you see it, a Ctrl-C doesn't lose the run: it keeps executing server-side and
you resume it with `widget detached wait <id>`. (A Ctrl-C while the start request is
still in flight is the one window with no id to resume from.)

The SDK also offers `start_and_wait()`, a self-healing one-liner that picks the
right path by itself — that is the production shortcut. This starter spells the
lifecycle out because teaching the difference is the point.

Copy-paste unit: this file + `widget/inputs.py` + `widget/errors.py` + `widget/usage.py` +
`widget/artifacts.py`. The
three mode packages never share lifecycle code, so the demo commands below are deliberate
mirrors of their `blocking` / `detached` twins: only `start_and_wait()` differs.

    Credentials come from `PIPELEX_API_KEY` / `PIPELEX_BASE_URL`. The method arrives as exactly
    one of three selectors, which is the SDK's own rule: inline `mthds_contents` (the bundle's
    `.mthds` files as strings — one entry for a single-file bundle, several for a multi-file
    one), a hosted catalog id (`method_id`), or a published address (`method_ref`). The demos
    below send the bundle they ship; a command written by `make add-method` sends the selector
    its `method.json` holds, and the SDK refuses a request carrying more than one.

    What comes back is the run's whole `RunResults`: `.main_stuff` is the content the pipe named as
    its result (a completed run that names none raises `MissingMainStuffError`), and beside it are
    the usage pair the command prints as a cost report and the references to whatever files the run
    produced. The blocking mode hands back the same object, so a command reads the same in either.
