"""The blocking CLI — one request, one response, done.

The simplest way to run a method: `client.execute(...)` and you have the result.
Behind the hosted gateway a run longer than ~30s is cut off (run `generate-image`
to see it happen) — that is what `widget attended` and `widget detached` are for.

Copy-paste unit: this file + `widget/inputs.py` + `widget/errors.py` + `widget/usage.py` +
`widget/artifacts.py`. The
three mode packages never share lifecycle code, so the demo commands below are deliberate
mirrors of their `attended` / `detached` twins: only `execute_pipe()` differs.

    Credentials come from `PIPELEX_API_KEY` / `PIPELEX_BASE_URL`. The method arrives as exactly

    `.mthds` files as strings — one entry for a single-file bundle, several for a multi-file
    one), a hosted catalog id (`method_id`), or a published address (`method_ref`). The demos

    its `method.json` holds, and the SDK refuses a request carrying more than one.

    `results_from_execute` lifts the blocking response onto it, so `.main_stuff` (the content the
    pipe named as its result — a completed run that names none raises `MissingMainStuffError`), the
