"""Rename the pipelex-starter-python template placeholders to a real project.

This is the deterministic engine behind the `/bootstrap` skill. It does the
mechanical, error-prone part — renaming the package directory and substituting
the project name (in its dist, package, and title forms) across the code,
config, docs, and license — so the skill (and the human) can focus on collecting
good inputs and verifying the result.

Why a script instead of a pile of Edit calls: the placeholder `widget` is a
single token that must become two different targets depending on context — the
dash-form distribution / CLI name in command positions, the underscore-form
package name in imports and paths — plus the `Widget` title and one filesystem
rename. Getting that split right by hand every time someone clones the template
is exactly what a script is for. It is also safe to run with --dry-run, which is
what makes it testable, and it hard-fails if any placeholder token survives the
substitution.

The script only transforms files. It does NOT touch git, run `uv lock`, run the
checks, or remove the bootstrap skill — the SKILL.md orchestrates those so each
step stays reviewable and the script stays a pure, idempotent transform.

# widget` and `from widget import x` are the package form with nothing after the
# token, and reading them as the dist form emits `import invoice-extractor`. What
# precedes the token decides that one, which is why it is not anchored to the
# start of a line — the same statement appears indented inside a function, quoted
# inside a test fixture, and inline in a sentence in the docs.

# word, so a user's own title or description may legitimately contain it, and
# `--title "Acme widget"` came back as `Acme invoice-extractor` when the title pass
# ran before the dist pass.
